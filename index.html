        <p id="aboutdesc">My name Akil Kamara. I am 15 years old and currently attend the Roosevelt High School for Early College Studies. I am currently a rising Sophomore. Right now, I'm doing the All Star Code Summer Intensive program in New York. Through this program, I am learning about coding in languages including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Through both of these, I was able to learn many things that will be useful for me in the future, or near future.</p>
